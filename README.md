                    "label": "image 1"
                },
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "file": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png",
                    "label": "Image 2"
                }
            ],
            "category": 1
        },
        
        ...
    ]
}

```


For a POST request, you can decide to use a formData to send your request with the following body parameters `name`, `images`, `description`, `price`, `restaurant`, `category` and payload:

```json
{
  "name": "Jollof Rice",
  "description": "This is the best food you have ever tasted",
  "price": 4000,
  "restaurant": 1,
  "category": 1,
  "images": "[ListOfImages base64]" 
}
```
The `images` field is best handled using formData. But you can use it in other ways based on your use case.

### /api/dishes/<id>/ GET

The `id` parameter is used to get a specific dish. If a non-existent id is not provided, a 404 NOT FOUND response would be received by the client. In order to avoid this the right id must be given.


The expected response gotten will be as follows:


```json

{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Swallow fufu",
    "description": "This is the description",
    "price": "3000.00",
    "restaurant": 1,
    "ratings": "0.0",
    "favourite": [],
    "_ingredients": [
        "onions",
        "carrot",
        "green peas"
    ],
    "restaurant_details": {
        "name": "",
        "ratings": 0.0
    },
    "get_category": {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "english meals",
        "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png"
    },
    "images": [
        {
            "id": 3,
            "file": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png",
            "label": ""
        }
    ],
    "category": 1
}

```
### /api/dishes/<id>/ GET, PUT, DELETE
Get request retrieves a single item by `id`.
The delete and the put requests are used for updating or permanently deleting the dish item.

The PUT request has a payload similar to that of the POST request, altghough you must ensure that
that every request ends in a slash (/).

# Categories
## /api/categories/ GET, POST
For Categories, the above endpoint can be used to likewise perform POST and GET operations.
The endpoint retrieves all the category data in the database. It also creates new categories with unique names. This depends on the method used in the request, whether a GET or POST request.

The Payload the client should expect to receive from a GET request is as follows:

```json
{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "english meals",
            "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png"
        }
    ]
}

```

Here, every category returns a paginated response of `id`, `name` and `image` in the payload.

Post request, on the other hand, does a different thing. It creates a new `category` with the following payload:

```json
  {
    "name": "traditional dishes",
    "image": "<FileData base64>"
  }

```
After being created, the response will contain the payload created.



## /api/categories/<id>/ GET, PUT, DELETE
The GET request will retrieve a single item based on the id provided as parameter.

The delete and the put requests are used for updating or permanently deleting categories.
The delete request does not need any payload, only the `id` parameters is received by the backend service and act upon. 

The PUT request, on the other hand requires a payload, same as the POST request.
